"""Tests for the CodeQL GitHub Actions workflow configuration.

These tests are structural asserts on the parsed YAML. They do not execute the
workflow -- they only verify its shape. The central regression guard is the
summary job name: it must be exactly ``CodeQL`` (case-sensitive) because the
main-branch ruleset requires a check-run named ``CodeQL``. Renaming that job
will stop PRs from merging. See issue #431 for context (the migration from
GitHub's "default setup" to this advanced workflow file).
