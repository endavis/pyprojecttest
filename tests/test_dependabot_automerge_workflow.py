"""Tests for the dependabot auto-merge GitHub Actions workflow configuration.

These tests are structural asserts on the parsed YAML. They do not execute the
workflow — they only verify its shape. The most important guarantee here is the
step ordering inside the ``enable-automerge`` job (see issue #423): the
``ready-to-merge`` label must be applied *before* ``gh pr merge --auto`` is
invoked so that a failure of the merge call cannot skip the label.

Issue #424 split the blocked-label handler out into a sibling workflow
(``dependabot-blocked-label.yml``) so this workflow no longer fires on
``labeled`` events. The ``TestOnTriggers`` and ``TestConcurrency`` classes
below guard that split.

Issue #428 added a preceding ``Generate App token`` step to the
``enable-automerge`` job. Applying the ``ready-to-merge`` label with a GitHub
App token (instead of the workflow's ``GITHUB_TOKEN``) is what allows the
downstream ``Merge Gate`` workflow to re-run on the ``labeled`` event —
``GITHUB_TOKEN`` is prohibited from triggering further workflow runs to
prevent recursion. The ``TestAppTokenStep`` class and several assertions in
``TestEnableAutomergeStepOrdering`` and ``TestStickyCommentStep`` guard that
wiring.
