"""Tests for the production Release publish workflow (issue #665).

Structural asserts on `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The central regression
guard is the artifact split: SBOM files (`sbom.json`, `sbom.xml`) must live
in a separate `sbom` artifact from the wheels/sdist `dist` artifact, because
twine (called by the publish jobs) inspects every file in `packages-dir` and
rejects anything that isn't a `.whl` or `.tar.gz` with `InvalidDistribution`.

These tests do not execute the workflow — they only verify its shape. Sibling
file: `tests/test_testpypi_workflow.py`.
