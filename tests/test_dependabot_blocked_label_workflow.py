"""Tests for the dependabot blocked-label GitHub Actions workflow configuration.

These tests are structural asserts on the parsed YAML. They do not execute the
workflow -- they only verify its shape. This workflow was split out from
``dependabot-automerge.yml`` in issue #424 so that the ``labeled`` trigger no
longer fires the main auto-merge workflow on every auto-applied dependabot
label (see the Context section of that issue's plan for the motivation).

The central regression guards here are:

1. The workflow triggers on ``pull_request_target: labeled`` only -- no other
   event types. Adding ``opened`` or ``synchronize`` would defeat the whole
   purpose of the split.
2. The ``handle-blocked-label`` job preserves the exact ``if:`` conditions and
   step sequence from the original job (disable auto-merge -> remove
   ``ready-to-merge`` label -> post sticky comment). The sticky-comment marker
   must survive intact so that the dedupe logic in ``dependabot-automerge.yml``
   and this workflow share a single comment slot.
