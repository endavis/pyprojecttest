"""Tests for the CI GitHub Actions workflow configuration.

These tests are structural asserts on the parsed YAML. They do not execute the
workflow -- they only verify its shape.

Scope is intentionally minimal: we guard the three invariants that matter for
issue #424:

1. ``labeled`` is NOT in the ``pull_request`` event type list. Keeping it
   there would cause every auto-applied label on a dependabot PR to spawn a
   duplicate CI run (the motivation for the split introduced in #424).
2. A workflow-level ``concurrency`` block exists with ``cancel-in-progress:
   true`` and a key that includes ``github.head_ref || github.ref``. This
   ensures a new push to a PR cancels the in-flight run on the prior commit.
3. The ``workflow_call`` trigger exposes a ``full_matrix`` boolean input
   (default ``false``) so the sibling ``ci-full-matrix.yml`` workflow can
   dispatch the full-matrix run via ``uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml``.
