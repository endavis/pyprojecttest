### Tooling roles

The template layers a small runtime package, a heavier set of development tools, and `doit` as the dev task runner. Knowing which tool belongs to which audience prevents the most common architectural mistake: treating `doit` as if it were the application's user-facing CLI. See [Tooling Roles and Architectural Boundaries](development/tooling-roles.md) for the full breakdown.
