## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Add frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `audience`, and `tags`:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: My New Guide
   description: Short description for the index
   audience:
     - users
     - contributors
   tags:
     - setup
     - getting-started
   ---
   ```

2. Place the file in the appropriate directory

3. Run `python tools/generate_doc_toc.py` to update this index

4. The pre-commit hook will also run automatically on commit
