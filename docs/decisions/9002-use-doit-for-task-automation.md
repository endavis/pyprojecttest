# ADR-9002: Use doit for task automation

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Use **doit** as the task automation framework for common operations like testing, linting, building, and deployment.

## Rationale

doit is a Python-based build tool that uses pure Python for task definitions (no DSL to learn), provides automatic task dependency resolution and incremental builds, and encourages modular task organization. Being Python-native means no context switching for developers already working in Python.

## Scope

doit is a **development task runner only**. It exists to make contributor
workflows (testing, linting, releases, issue and PR creation) reproducible
and discoverable. It is not part of the published package's public API.

- doit must **not** be used to front the application's user-facing CLI. The
  application's CLI is a console script under `src/__PACKAGE_NAME__/`. End users
  of the published package should never need to install `doit` to use it.
- `doit` is a **development dependency only**, declared under
  `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` in `pyproject.toml`. It is not
  installed when adopters install the published package. (Historical note:
  it was briefly placed in `[project] dependencies` per #65 as a packaging
  convenience; #348 moved it to dev to align with the boundary above.)

For the broader layering rationale, see
[Tooling Roles and Architectural Boundaries](../../development/tooling-roles.md).
