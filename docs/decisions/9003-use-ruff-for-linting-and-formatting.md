# ADR-9003: Use ruff for linting and formatting

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Use **ruff** as the single tool for both linting and code formatting, replacing flake8, black, isort, and other tools.

## Rationale

ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust that consolidates multiple tools into one. It includes linting rules from flake8, pylint, and others, plus a Black-compatible formatter and import sorting. Single configuration in `pyproject.toml` and 10-100x faster execution than traditional Python-based tools.
